# Node.js Global Mentoring Program
Welcome to the Node.js Global Mentoring Program ðŸš€

This repository contains all the content related to program. We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) as platform to document the modules.

`/Modules/docs` - contains the content of the book itself (there is a separate folder for each module, e.g `/Modules/docs/1-Intro`)

## Run the book

Follow the instructions below:

```
cd Modules
npm i
npm start // the book will be available by http://localhost:3000
```

## Contribute

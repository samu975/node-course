# Identity providers (Optional)
## Definition 
An identity provider (IdP) is a component of the system that provides an end user or device with a single set of login credentials across multiple applications.

As an example, considered log to application using user Google Account. In this example, Google Sign-In is the identity provider.

## How do identity providers work?
IdPs communicates using languages like Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or data formats like Open Authorization (OAuth).
Using an identity provider is convenient for users because it means they no longer must remember multiple logins.

From the service provider's point of view, this approach can be more secure for the following reasons:
  - provides a central audit trail of all access events
  - saves users the hassle of creating and maintaining multiple usernames and passwords with single sign-on (SSO)
  - client application doesn't have to be concerned about protecting personally identifiable information (PII)

## Types of identity providers
The two main types of identity providers are enterprise-based and social-based. An enterprise based identity provider used in a corporate enterprise for identity and access management (IAM).

Popular companies that offer IdP services include the following:
  - Google
  - Facebook
  - Apple
  - Microsoft
  - Amazon Web Services (AWS)

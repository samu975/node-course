# Introduction

Welcome to Node.js testing module ðŸ‘‹

### What will you do in this module?

In this module you will:
- recap core testing concepts (testing pyramid, unit / integration / e2e testing)
- get acquainted with common Node.js testing libraries
- learn how to use Jest as a tool for writing tests
- see examples of unit, integration and e2e tests

### Why tests are needed?

Before we dive deep into testing practices in Node.js, letâ€™s start by answering the main question: `Why is testing so important and why should developers write tests?` ðŸ¤”

Writing tests helps you to:
1. build confidence in how your code works
2. reduce potential bugs & deliver new changes quickly
3. receive instant feedback & catch regression early
4. refactor, deploy and release with higher confidence

Happy learning!

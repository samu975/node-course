# Practical task
### Prerequisites

You are working for a delivery company that has offices in Great Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands. You are a part of backend team that focuses on building internal tools for that company. One day you received a new request from a customer to create a public holidays module. This module will:
- show a list of public holidays for specific country for the current year
- show the next public holiday for specific country
- show if today is public holiday in your location

After some time of investigation, you found [Nager.Date API](https://date.nager.at/swagger/index.html) that meets the requirements above. Your customer agreed to use it, so now you can start the development. 

Once youâ€™ve finished writing code, you have to cover your module with tests. 

### Source code

You can find the implementation [here](https://git.epam.com/ld-global-coordinators/js-programs/nodejs-gmp-coursebook/-/tree/master/public-for-mentees/5-testing).

### Task 1

Write unit tests for [public-holidays.service.ts](https://git.epam.com/ld-global-coordinators/js-programs/nodejs-gmp-coursebook/-/blob/master/public-for-mentees/5-testing/src/services/public-holidays.service.ts) and [helpers.ts](https://git.epam.com/ld-global-coordinators/js-programs/nodejs-gmp-coursebook/-/blob/master/public-for-mentees/5-testing/src/helpers.ts) files. Keep in mind that any external calls are mocked in unit tests.

### Task 2

Write integration tests for [public-holidays.service.ts](https://git.epam.com/ld-global-coordinators/js-programs/nodejs-gmp-coursebook/-/blob/master/public-for-mentees/5-testing/src/services/public-holidays.service.ts). Do not forget that in this case you make real calls to the API.

### Task 3

Get code coverage with tests for your application. Strive to have no less than 90% of code coverage.

### Task 4

Select any 2 endpoints from [Nager.Date API](https://date.nager.at/swagger/index.html) and write e2e tests for them. 

### Evaluation criteria
- `60 - 69` - Tasks 1 and/or 2 are done.
- `70 - 79` - Tasks 1, 2 and 3 are done.
- `80 - 89` - All tasks are completed. Code coverage is less than 90%.
- `90 - 100` - All tasks are completed. Code coverage is more than 90%.

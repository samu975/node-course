The decision between SQL and NoSQL will depend largely on the workloads you plan to support and the structure and amount of data.
SQL databases are established with fixed schema design and a set structure.
They are ideal for applications that require multi-row transactions or for legacy systems that were built for a relational structure.
NoSQL databases are easily scalable, flexible and simple to use as they have no rigid schema and are ideal for applications with no specific schema definitions.
In additional, many applications have implemented both SQL and NoSQL database systems to meet their different requirements, making it possible to get the best of both worlds.

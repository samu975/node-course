:::tip Benefits
- Decentralised and adaptable
    - Manage very large amounts data spread out across many servers.
      NoSQL databases can rapidly adapt to changing requirements with frequent updates and new features.
- Flexible data models
    - Can store and combine different data types, they are very versatile as compared to SQL databases.
      Easy to start building a database without needing to spend effort and time on planning upfront.
- Easy to integrate with applications
- Scalability and efficiency when working with big data
  - Designed to be highly scalable and provide high write performance.
- Supports structured, unstructured and semi-structured data
    - Schemas do not have to be predefined and they can handle all data types.
- Supports a massive number of concurrent users
- Economical
    - NoSQL databases scale-out horizontally, making it cost-effective to expand capacity.
      Rather than upgrading expensive hardware, they can cheaply expand by simply adding servers or cloud instances.

:::danger Drawbacks
- Not effective with maintaining atomicity or accuracy
    - Data is quickly available thanks to the distributed nature of the database. However, it could be harder to ensure that the data is always consistent.
      Sometimes, queries might not return updated data or accurate information
- Unorganised
    - Unorganized, constantly changing and huge amount of data that can be stored in the database.
- No standardized language
    - There isnâ€™t a standard language to conduct NoSQL queries.
    The syntax used to query data varies for the different types of NoSQL databases.
- Less support and fewer available frameworks
  - While NoSQL has quickly been adopted, it has smaller user communities and, therefore, less support.

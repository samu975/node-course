:::info History
The acronym `NoSQL` was first used in 1998 by Carlo Strozzi while naming his lightweight, open-source "relational" database that did not use SQL.
The name came up again in 2009 when Eric Evans and Johan Oskarsson used it to describe non-relational databases.<br/>
:::

NoSQL means either `No SQL systems` or more commonly - `Not only SQL`, to focus on the fact some systems might support SQL-like query languages.
Unlike SQL, NoSQL does not store data in a relational format.
The data does not need to have a strict schema nor the usual SQL table structure.
However, not applying a schema at the data entry point also means it is more difficult to query NoSQL databases, maintain data consistency, and establish relationships between data sets.
Before going further, let's understand what is structured, unstructured and semi-structured data.

### Structured data

The structured data considered to be the data that:

- Adheres to a data model
- Has a clearly defined structure
- Follows a consistent order
- Can be easily accessed, searched, analyzed and utilized by a person or computer program

:::info Sources
- SQL Databases
- Spreadsheets such as Excel
- Network and Web server logs
:::

### Unstructured data

The unstructured data considered to be the data that:

- Doesn't follow a data model
- Doesn't have a structure that can be easily identified,
- Is not suitable for a standard relational database
- Has no pre-defined data model and stored in its native format
- Requires more work to process and understand.

### Semi-structured data

The semi-structured data considered to be the data that:

- Doesn't adhere to a data model but does have some structure
- No fixed or rigid schema in it
- Has some organizational properties
- Can store them in the relational database

:::info Sources
- E-mails
- XML and other markup languages
- TCP/IP packets
- Zipped files

## When to use NoSQL

The following reasons to choose NoSQL database:

- Data storage that is both structured and semi-structured
- Massive amounts of data
- Requirements for an architecture that scales out
- Modern application paradigms like microservices
- When ACID support is not needed

## Use Cases

### Session Store

NoSQL can be used as a global session store, which manages session information for user.

### Content Management

Content management can store information in any format including text, images, audio and video.
NoSQL offers a better option for storing multimedia content with flexible and open-ended data model.

### Big Data Processing

Big data is too large to be handled through traditional processing systems.
Real-time systems use stream processing to ingest new data while analyzing historical data.
Extracting some useful information from a large amount of data is pretty complex thing.
So, NoSQL databases are uniquely suited for such needs and allow to build todayâ€™s high-volume, high variety applications.
Instead of applying schema on write, NoSQL databases apply schema on read.

- ```What is Schema On Write?``` Schema on write is defined as creating a schema for data before writing into the database.
- ```What is Schema On Read?``` Schema on read is defined as creating the schema only when reading the data from the database.

### Internet of Things

IoT devices are connected to the internet or communications networks and they able to collect and share data without humans.
Billions of devices generating big amount of data, IoT NoSQL databases provide scalability and more flexible schema to IoT service providers.
Data in the IoT is almost by definition not completely known in advance and designing structured schemas is almost impossible.
The world is moving so fast that its applications must be flexible.
That's why NoSQL is the only right DB to use here.

## [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html)

:::info
Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data.
It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.
:::

### Requirements
- Installed NodeJS
- MongoDB on your machine or use the MongoDB cloud
- Installed ```mongoose``` and ```@types/mongoose``` npm package to your project

### Before start

- Before use ODM, create your first database in MongoDB. Then, create your first collection (Example - ```User```).
- Create file ```index.js``` in your project.

## Step 1

- Include ```mongoose``` in your project
- Open a connection to the created database. [How to connect](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html)

```ts
    import { connect, Schema, model, disconnect } from 'mongoose';

    await connect("YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING");
```

## Step 2

- Create database schema using ```mongoose```. [About schema](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)
- Create new model using this schema. [About model](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html)

```ts
    interface IUser {
      name: string;
      email: string;
      age?: number;
    }

    const userSchema = new Schema<IUser>({
        name: { type: String, required: true },
        email: { type: String, required: true },
        age: { type: Number, required: false },
    });

  const User = model<IUser>("User", userSchema);
```
[Schemas types](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html) for ```mongoose```.
When we created ```User``` model, it means that ```mongoose``` will automatically look for your created collection.
Now, you are able to work with this collection.

## Work with collection

- [Model API])(https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/model.html)

```ts
  // Create new model entity
  // Save this entity into DB

  const user = new User({
    name: "Name",
    email: "test@test.com",
    age: 18
  });

  await user.save();

  // To find one user or get an array of users
  const user: IUser = await User.findOne({ email: 'test@test.com' });
  const users: Array<IUser> = await User.find({ email: 'test@test.com' });

  // Or it is possible to use .where()
  const users: Array<IUser> = await User.where('email').eq('test@test.com');

  // Or get all rows and then use .where()
  const users: Array<IUser> = User.find().where({ email: 'test@test.com' });

  // Also it is possible to chain queries
  const users: Array<IUser> = User.find().where({ email: 'test@test.com' }).where({ age: 18 });
```

## Work with aggregations

Aggregation is a way of processing a large number of documents in a collection by means of passing them through different stages.
The stages make up what is known as a pipeline.
The stages in a pipeline can filter, sort, group, reshape and modify documents that pass through the pipeline.
MongoDB Aggregation can also perform relational-like joins, reshape documents, create new and update existing collections.

- [Aggregation Docs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/aggregate.html)

Most popular aggregation stages:
- $match – filters those documents we need to work with
- $group – does the aggregation job
- $sort – sorts the resulting documents

```db.collectionName.aggregate(stages, options)```

```ts
{
   _id: 1
   username: 'UserName_1',
   firstName: 'FirstName_1',
   lastName: 'LastName_1',
   age: 40
},
{
   _id: 2
   username: 'UserName_2',
   firstName: 'FirstName_2',
   lastName: 'LastName_1',
   age: 20
}
```

```ts
const result = await User.aggregate([ {$group : { _id : "$lastName", total:  { $sum : 1 }} }]);

// output: { "_id" : "LastName_1", total: 2 }
```

### Before end

- Close database connection

```ts
    import { disconnect } from 'mongoose';

    await disconnect();
```

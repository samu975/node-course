# Object Document Mapper

### Overview

The Object Document Mapper (ODM) is an interface that treats a document as a tree structure.
Similar to Object Relational Mapping (ORM), it is used to change the structure and content of a document.
And also allows to define data schemas which represent the data structure.
The usage of ODMs additionally simplifies the process of changing the database engine whenever the need arises.

Multiple ODMs are designed to support different NoSQL databases:
- [Express-Cassandra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-cassandra) is designed to work with Node.js for a NoSQL database like Cassandra
- [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) is designed for MongoDB database
- [Amazon DynamoDB DataMapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws/dynamodb-data-mapper)is a helper for DynamoDB

### Pros and Cons
:::tip Pros
- More productive work with Document DBs
- ODM can support predefined structure and collections validation
- Using ODM, it is possible to make collection schema similar to the SQL DBs
- Less time spending on code writing to work with DBs
:::

:::danger Cons
- If schemas and models were defined using ODM, relationship between them only exists within our application
- Need spend time to dive into used ODM library

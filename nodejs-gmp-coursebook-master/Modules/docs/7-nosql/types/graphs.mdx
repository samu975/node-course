# Graphs

# <div style={{textAlign: "center"}}> ![Overview](../img/graphs.jpeg) </div>

Third type of NoSQL databases is ```Graphs``` DB. <br/>
A graph database is a database designed for storing and querying data that is connected via defined relationships.
Graphs contain nodes, edges, and properties.
Data points in a graph database are nodes and these nodes are connected to related data via edges.
The data attached to each node are known as properties.
Graph databases aren’t restricted by predefined schema.
There are two types of graphs: property graphs and RDF graphs.
The property graph focuses on analytics and querying, while the RDF graph emphasizes data integration.
Both types of graph consist of a collection of points (vertices) and the connections between those points (edges).

```Graphs``` DBs provide a way to work with data and have basic CRUD operations:

- Read - Retrieve data
- Create - Insert new data
- Update - Update  data
- Delete - Delete data

## Specifics

- ```Consistency``` - offers eventual consistency with a period of inconsistency
- ```Query``` - can use specially defined query language like
[Cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/),
[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-overview-20130321/)
- ```Scaling``` - databases are distributed and resilient. They allow for horizontal scaling

## Use cases

Best choice for:

- Fraud detection and analytics
- Network and database infrastructure monitoring
- Recommendation engines
- Social networks
- Knowledge graph
- Identity and access management

## Most popular databases

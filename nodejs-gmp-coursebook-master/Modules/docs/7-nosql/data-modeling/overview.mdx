All NoSQL data modeling techniques are grouped into three major groups:

- Conceptual techniques
- General modeling techniques
- Hierarchy modeling techniques

Since many programmers are unfamiliar with NoSQL's flexibility, NoSQL data modeling techniques are very helpful.
NoSQL is not a single programming language like SQL, but rather a collection of database management principles.
Data modeling methods and approaches vary greatly from database to database.

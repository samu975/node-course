Modules are JavaScript libraries you can use, in your projects. Node.js provides built in dependency manager called NPM.

On the one hand, NPM is an online repository, that is using for distribution of open-source Node.js modules; on the other hand, it is a cli utility that provides package installation, package publishing and version and dependency management.

NPM consists of two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.
A lot of modules already published on npm, and this amount increased from day to day. You can use web [portal](https://www.npmjs.com/) to search for these modules.

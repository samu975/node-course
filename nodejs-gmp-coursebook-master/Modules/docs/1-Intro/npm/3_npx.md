# What is NPX

Starting from Node.js version v8.2.0 and npm v5.2.0 we have one more useful build-in tool named npx. With npx you can execute your package without installation, to do so run the following command:

```shell
npx <module>
```

The npx can be useful during a single time use package and reduce amount of global npm modules. 

You can find more about this tool using official [documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx).

# Introduction

In this module, we cover one of the fundamentals - the essential building blocks of Node applications and core modules.

The building blocks of Node applications which we are gonna talk about:

* [Events](/docs/event-emitter-vs-buffers-vs-streams/event_emitter) - many Node.js core libraries emit events. You can use EventEmitters to implement this pattern in your own applications.
* [Buffers](/docs/event-emitter-vs-buffers-vs-streams/buffer) provide a binary-friendly, higher-performance alternative to strings by exposing raw memory allocation outside the V8 heap.
* [Readable and Writable Streams](/docs/event-emitter-vs-buffers-vs-streams/streams) - an alternative way of interacting with file, network, process or I/O.
